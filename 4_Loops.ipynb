    "#### **Use FOR when:**\n",
    "- You have a definite collection to iterate over\n",
    "- You know the number of iterations\n",
    "- You're working with sequences, ranges, or iterables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use WHILE when:**\n",
    "- The number of iterations is unknown\n",
    "- You're waiting for a condition to change\n",
    "- You need input validation or interactive loops\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use BREAK when:**\n",
    "- You need to exit a loop early\n",
    "- You've found what you're searching for\n",
    "- An error or special condition occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use CONTINUE when:**\n",
    "- You want to skip specific iterations\n",
    "- You need to filter during iteration\n",
    "- You want to handle exceptions gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **PERFORMANCE TIPS**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **map() and filter()** return iterators - convert to list only when needed  \n",
    "2. **List comprehensions** are often faster than map/filter for simple operations  \n",
    "3. **enumerate()** is more efficient than range(len())  \n",
    "4. **zip()** stops at the shortest sequence - use `itertools.zip_longest()` for different behavior  \n",
    "5. **Generator expressions** with parentheses use less memory than list comprehensions  \n",
